Crafter CMS SDK for JavaScript in the browser and Node JS

## Project Structure

- `src` contains the ES6 sources for developing
- `lib` contains the ES5 sources generated by babel
- `dist` contains the ES5 bundle generated by webpack to use in browsers


## Building

- `npm run compile` will use babel to generate ES5 sources in the `lib` folder
- `npm run build` will use webpack to generate a production ES5 bundle under `dist` folder
- `npm run dev` will use webpack to generate a development ES5 bundle under `dist` folder and watch for changes

## Testing

Run `npm test` to execute all tests under the folder `test`, before running this command you need to:
- Start a crafter authoring environment
- Create a site using the `editorial` blueprint with the same name
